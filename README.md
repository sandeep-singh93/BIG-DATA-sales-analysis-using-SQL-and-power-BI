# BIG-DATA-sales-analysis-using-SQL-and-power-BI
In this project i have done data analysis using SQL and then then Visualization using POWER BI . 

1.We need to first download MYSQL database in our local machine.
   LINK :- https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

2. Along with that download the IDE of your choice [ i have used popsql ].

3 We can do the initial analysis using SQL to see any discrepency in the DATA.

4. Then we do further analysis in POWER BI  using DAX formula to transform our DATA and generate a report (i.e DASHBOARD or VISUALIZATION)

The required "sql dump" is provided along with the simple DASHBOARD i have created.
